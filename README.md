# Dove Shooting Game
- I created this game using the platform visual studio code, using python coding.
- It took me approximately 6 hours to create this game in classes in a span of 3 weeks.
- The game contents are:
  - You, the player, controls a white dove that has the ability to shoot its excrements endlessly at an enemy
  - The enemy is a black raven that will go towards you, and if you make contact with the raven, your health point will deplete by 1. It only takes one of the dove's excrements to defeat one raven.
  - There will be an assortments of seeds that will occasionally spawn and make its way towards you, if you collect it, your health point will increase by 1.
  - There are two texts on the top left of the game screen, "health" and "score". You start will 10 health points, which will deplete by 1 every time you touch an enemy. Your score will increase by 10 every time you defeat an enemy.
